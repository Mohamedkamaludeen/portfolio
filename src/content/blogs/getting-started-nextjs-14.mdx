# Getting Started with Next.js 14 and App Router

Next.js 14 introduces significant improvements to the App Router, making it more powerful and developer-friendly. In this tutorial, we'll explore the key features and how to get started.

## What's New in Next.js 14?

The App Router in Next.js 14 brings several exciting features:

- **Server Components by Default**: Improved performance with automatic server-side rendering
- **Streaming and Suspense**: Better user experience with progressive rendering
- **Server Actions**: Simplified data mutations without API routes
- **Improved Caching**: More control over caching strategies

## Setting Up Your Project

First, create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## App Router Basics

The App Router uses a file-system based router where folders define routes. Here's the basic structure:

```
app/
  layout.tsx    # Root layout
  page.tsx      # Home page
  about/
    page.tsx    # About page
  blog/
    page.tsx    # Blog listing
    [slug]/
      page.tsx  # Dynamic blog post
```

## Server Components

By default, all components in the App Router are Server Components. This means they run on the server and send HTML to the client:

```tsx
// This is a Server Component
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  const json = await data.json()
  
  return <div>{json.title}</div>
}
```

## Client Components

When you need interactivity, use the `"use client"` directive:

```tsx
"use client"

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  )
}
```

## Layouts and Templates

Layouts wrap multiple pages and persist across navigation:

```tsx
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <nav>Navigation</nav>
        {children}
        <footer>Footer</footer>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

## Data Fetching

Next.js 14 makes data fetching simple with async/await:

```tsx
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
    cache: 'force-cache' // Static generation
  })
  return res.json()
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData()
  return <main>{data.title}</main>
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Server Components by Default**: Only use Client Components when needed
2. **Optimize Images**: Use next/image for automatic optimization
3. **Implement Loading States**: Use loading.tsx for better UX
4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Use error.tsx for error boundaries
5. **Leverage Caching**: Understand and use caching strategies effectively

## Conclusion

Next.js 14's App Router represents a major step forward in React framework development. By embracing Server Components and improving developer experience, it makes building performant web applications easier than ever.

Start experimenting with these features in your next project, and you'll quickly see the benefits!
